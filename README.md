# ebu-tt-live-toolkit

This is the repository for the interoperability kit of [EBU-TT Live](https://tech.ebu.ch/publications/tech3370). 

The kit is envisaged to contain a set of components for generating, testing and distributing subtitle documents in EBU-TT Part 3 format.

This is an open source project. Anyone is welcome to contribute to the development of the components. Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/ebu/ebu-tt-live-toolkit/wiki) for the list of required components, guidelines and release plan. 

If you would like to contribute, please contact <subtitling@ebu.ch> or <nigel.megitt@bbc.co.uk>

The Schema definitions XSD
==========================

The schema definitions are to be found embedded in the Python library in the xsd subfolder.
The root schemadocument is called *ebutt_live.xsd*.

The Python library
==================

The library uses XSD schemas from the xsd subdirectory. The bindings are auto-generated by PyXB.
For binding generation one can use the following code:

    pyxbgen -r --binding-root=./ebu_tt_live/bindings -m __init__ --schema-root=./ebu_tt_live/xsd/ -u ebutt_live.xsd

The bindings will keep the validation sane and PyXB makes sure that updates are working as
expected. Should the schema be modified a regeneration can be run and the bindings will respect
the changes.
